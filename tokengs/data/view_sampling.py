"""Geometry-based "even" view sampling helpers.

Used by ``Provider._get_indices_static`` when ``opt.view_sampling == "even"``.
The idea: partition a scene's camera view-directions (points on a sphere) into
``k`` spatial clusters via k-means, then pick one random view per cluster each
iteration -- clusters guarantee roughly-even sphere coverage, the per-cluster
random pick gives variety across iterations.

Numpy-only on purpose: this runs inside forked DataLoader workers, so it must
import cheaply and carry no torch/scipy/sklearn dependency. Determinism is
controlled entirely by the ``seed`` argument to :func:`kmeans_unit` so that all
workers produce identical clusters.
